This is a document for python.
This is for a bot to be used for homework.
I usually back out of difficult tasks because I usually don't know everything in there.
But not today, I want this project to work out for him as it will really help me in schoolwork.


This project is meant to be a bot that scans an online homework, looks for the questions through deep learning.
Checks the internet through returns relevant answers to the questions,double checks it through deep learning.
And then answers the questions according to the relevancy of the questions.


so basically it checks the internet for answers cross references it with the ones it has and then creates a relevant answer to the question.

I'll be putting this project on hold for the timebeing.
